	<h1>My Favorite Team: Chicago White Sox</h1>

			<p>Growing up in the South Loop of Chicago, I have been a White Sox fan for my entire life.</p>
			<p>Besides growing up close to where they play, I really fell in love with the team when they won the World Series in 2005.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, since 2005 they haven't been very good. In fact they have been really bad, only making the playoffs once since they won it all in 2005.</p>
			<p>However, this year is the year they are supposed to end their rebuild and start contending again in the AL Central for a playoff spot.</p>
			<p>I am optimistic, but we'll see what happens.</p>
